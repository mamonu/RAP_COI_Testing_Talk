# RAP_COI_Testing_Talk
A short talk about testing and how it relates to  RAP (Reproducible Analytical Pipelines)


Covering :

- [x] What to test?
- [x] Manual Testing
- [x] Coverage
- [x] Automated testing 
- [x] Property based testing
- [x] Mutation Testing
- [x] Integration Testing
- [x] End2End Testing

It has a Python slant but I tried to include R implementations where availiable. 
But what I really wanted to talk about was the concepts.


It was presented on  28th/May/2019 at the Reproducible Analytical Pipelines Community of Interest gathering at ONS in London
